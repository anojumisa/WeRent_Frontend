## Project Overview
This project is the realization of requirements outlined in the [Product Requirement Document (PRD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jZDhfKEi6BC472W_1izGeO8zsQGtz5pg/view?usp=sharing), specifically focusing on the Review Page for WeRent. The review system is designed to guide users in making informed rental decisions by providing insights into product quality and fit, based on past renter experiences.

The implementation process was guided by detailed discussions between the development team, ensuring the final deliverable aligns with the product vision and user needs. Following a comprehensive analysis of the PRD and its corresponding user stories, the team prioritized and implemented key features to deliver a user-friendly and efficient review experience.

## User Stories Implemented

The following user stories were identified and implemented to meet the requirements for the Product Review functionality:

1.	Product Detail Page - Number of Reviews

	Display the total number of reviews for each product on its detail page, offering users a quick overview of the product’s popularity and credibility.

2.	Review Page - Reviewer Rating
	
    Allow users to see individual reviewer ratings to gauge satisfaction and product performance.

3.	Product Detail Page - Overall Product Rating
	
    Showcase the product’s aggregate rating on the product detail page, calculated as the average of all individual reviewer ratings.

4.	Review Page - “Read More” Button
	
    Enable a collapsible view for long comments, displaying the first 150 characters with a “Read More” option to expand and view the complete comment.

5.	Review Page - Review Post Date
	
    Include the date each review was posted to provide context about its recency and relevance.

6.	Product Detail Page - Review Section
	
    Integrate a dedicated review section on the product detail page, providing a seamless way for users to explore reviews directly from the product listing.

7.	Review Page - Reviewer Photos or Videos
	
    Allow reviewers to upload photos or videos, enhancing trust and providing more detailed insights into product quality and fit.

8.	Review Page - Sort by Rating
